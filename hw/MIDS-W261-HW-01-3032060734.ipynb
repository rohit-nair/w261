    "Big Data in a broad sense refers to data sets that are so large and complex that special tools and skills are required to process them and the approaches from a or two decade ago are inadequate. Big data is usually characterized by the 3Vs: Volume, Velocity and Variety. Volume refers to the amount of data being captured or processed. Pre-big data era volume was measured in Giga and Tera bytes while in Big Data era it has grown to Penta/Zeta bytes. Velocity refers to the rate at which data is captured. In the age of Twitter and Facebook, there are millions of interactions happening every second leading to Gigabytes of data generated per second. Variety refers to the kind of data being generated. Some could be numeric such as revenue or conversions while others could be images or text. Sometimes a fourth component Veracity is also taken into consideration while defining Big Data.\n",

    "When trying to predict $Y$ using a trained model $f(X)$, we are interested in determining how well our predictions are. We can do so by calculating expected squared prediction error as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Err(x)=E[(Y−\\hat{f} (x))^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be further decomposed into various components as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Err(x) = (E[\\hat{f}(x) - f(x))^2 + E[(\\hat{f}(x) - E[\\hat{f}(x)])^2] + \\sigma^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can essentially be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Err(x) = Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible Error$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The insight this decomposition provides is that any error in our prediction results for these three factors: Bias, Variance and an Irreducible Error. Of these, Bias and Variance are modelling errors while the irreducible error happens due to inherent error in the data for example as caused by error in calliberation of an instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Bias and Variance are modelling error, we can take steps to reduce their contributions while training a model. Bias occurs when the model is inherently simple and doesn't fit well to the data. This in machine learning is called Underfitting. Variance occurs when the model is comples and has a lots of features that do not address the inherent behavior of the data. In this case too the model doesn't fit the data well and this scenario is called overfitting. Overfitting because while training a model, the model perfoms exceedingly well on the training data as it fits the outliers and noise in the training data while it performs poorly with test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a Bias-Variance tradeoff in a model. We can tune our model to either have high bias or high variance while in reality we try to tune the model to where we minimize the error in the model. If we plot Bias and Variance against Model Complexity, we will find that towards the left of the complexity scale, Bias is high and Variance is low while as we move towards right, Variance gets larger as Bias reduces. From the equation above, model error is high lowards the left and the right and the optimum model complexity that minimizes the error is somewhere in between.\n"

This is due to the fact that each of the reducer has a partial view of word counts as it's relying on the sorted output from each mapper. This can be rectified in multiple ways. One approach would be for current reducer to emit the word counts and have another reducer collates these outputs. Another would be to have a stage with multiple reducers listening to a small subset of mappers each and collating and passing the word counts forward to another reducer. Yet another would be for the mapper to have dictionary to keep track of word counts."

In other words, you need an output file with only 2 lines, one giving you the number of words staring with a lowercase ('a' to 'z'), and the other line indicating the number of words starting with an uppercase letter ('A' to 'Z'). In the pWordCount.sh, please insert a sort command to collate the output key-value pair records by key from the mappers. E.g., sort -k1,1. Use \"man sort\" to learn more about Unix sorts."
